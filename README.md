# 04_BattleTank

#CONCEPT:

An Open World Tank Game where your objective is to eliminate all the possible enemies while dodging, covering after obstacles and hills, and running from them.


Timing your shots in this game is essential as your firing-speed is slow.
The landscape will be a war-themed map with tank ruins, destroyed buildings, and reallistic tank SFX combined with some intense background music.

#RULES:
   WIN CONDITION:
   To Eliminate all possible (unfriendly) tanks on the battlefield.(When a AI-Controlled tank is destroyed he won't respawn)
   *Optional* Second win condition may be when more than 1 tanks are still alive after the time limit and the winner is calculated by how much damage each individual tank has provoked. The most ferocious one wins.
   LOSE CONDITION: If your tank gets destroyed. It will blow up and the game will be over.

Actions
- Movement will be based on independently using left and right treads. The move speed will be extremely slow and turning sharply won't be possible without going into a almost static position
- Your weapon is a cannon mounted on a rotating turret, which will fire a powerful projectile over a long distance.
- Collect repair packs from the ground to refill health.


Illegal Actions

- STEEP hills will not be climbable.
- Structures cannot be destroyed.
